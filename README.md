## About
SecurePass is a simple password generator that the user can use to generate a password using random characters from the ascii database.

## Three main objectives
1. The app must be able to generate a random password from given set of characters
2. The generator must be easy for the user to use 
3. Use tkinter to create the window for the password generator

## Using the generator
The generator is set up to be as simple as possible for anybody to use, when the window opens up it automatically generates a random password which the user can use or the user can click "Generate Password" button to create a new random password.
There is also a copy/paste icon next to the password which the user can use to copy or they can highlight all the characters and copy for themselves.

## Why a password generator
With our lives being ever more digital its important to make sure our personal information is kept secure, according to a Google survey over 65% of people reuse passwords across multiple, if not all sites. If this wasnt bad enough a Verizon report showed that over 80% of hacking related breaches are down to compromised passwords.

This is where the password generator comes in. Easy to use. Hard to crack.
